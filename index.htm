      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9HuPUCB0dD/" target="_blank">Instagram 014</a> [2020] is an attempt at creating a pedagogical virtual instrument on Instagram. The post consists of 8 videos. What you hear: 8 sine waves tuned to the frequencies of a C major scale plus octave. What you see: 3 colours denoting diatonic function (blue: tonic triad, green: subdominant triad, red: dominant triad). Improvise counterpoint with a friend or conduct your family through a harmonic progression right from the comfort of your Instagram app. The rest of my posts are memes i've made.</p>
